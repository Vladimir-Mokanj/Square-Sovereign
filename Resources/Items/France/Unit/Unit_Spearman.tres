Description = "Meet the Spearman: The original advocate for battlefield social distancing. Wielding a lance longer than his patience, he keeps enemies at a comfortable jab's distance. He turns a cavalry charge into a shish kebab quicker than you can say \"personal space.\" Not compensating for anything; he's just really into the concept of space."
